# Quick Skeleton UI Boilerplate

This is a quick skeleton UI boilerplate made by following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_A0qQ7AuK8) by [Huntabyte](https://www.youtube.com/@Huntabyte)

This showcases skeleton UI - a svelete + tailwind UI library - and acts as quick starting point for further application development.

This app features a simply note making app with notes stored to local storage, made even more convenient by the utility that skeleton UI offers for the same.

Use the code as seen fit!

## Usage

Run as follows:

```bash
pnpm dev
# or npm run dev
# or yarn dev, etc...
```
